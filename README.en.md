## üìñ Project Overview


InstallFlow is a batch processing tool designed for macOS to help you quickly install locally downloaded application files. It eliminates the need to manually handle DMG, PKG, and other installation package formats one by one.

### üéØ Core Value

- **Solves Pain Points**: Batch process local Mac app installation packages, avoiding repetitive mounting and dragging operations
- **Target Users**: Mac users, developers, and IT administrators who need to batch install local applications
- **Design Philosophy**: One script, interactive selection, intelligent processing, secure installation

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üöÄ Multi-Format Support
- **DMG Files**: Auto-mount, extract apps, intelligently handle nested structures (up to 5 levels deep)
- **ISO Files**: Disk image mounting, app extraction, support for multi-level nested structures
- **PKG Files**: Invoke system installer for installation, support nested PKG processing
- **ZIP Files**: Extract and retrieve applications or DMG files within
- **APP Files**: Directly copy to Applications folder with automatic version detection

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Mechanisms
- **Path Validation**: Strict path security checks to prevent command injection
- **Sudo Permission Management**: Background keepalive mechanism to maintain admin privileges
- **Temporary File Cleanup**: Automatically clean up temporary files during installation
- **Permission Handling**: Auto-remove quarantine attributes to ensure apps run properly
- **Version Detection**: Intelligent app version detection with automatic update or skip duplicate installations
- **Signal Handling**: Comprehensive exit cleanup mechanism to ensure resource release

### üí° Interactive Experience
- **Terminal Interface**: Navigate with arrow keys, select with spacebar, confirm with enter, 30 items per page display
- **Keyboard Support**: Ctrl+A select all, Ctrl+N deselect all, ESC/q to exit
- **Real-time Feedback**: Colorized log output with detailed installation progress and timestamps
- **Smart Notifications**: Apple Silicon compatibility detection and Rosetta installation reminders
- **Drag & Drop Support**: Support dragging folders to terminal window
- **Installation Reports**: Complete installation summary with success rate statistics and categorized results display

### üé® Web Interface
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Fast access based on edge computing
- **Modern Design**: Glassmorphism effects with responsive layout
- **Easy Sharing**: One-click copy installation command

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers (Edge Computing)
- **Technology**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Design**: Inline single-file architecture with glassmorphism UI

### Installation Script
- **Language**: Bash Script (1,335 lines of professional code with complete Chinese documentation)
- **Compatibility**: macOS 10.15+ (Catalina and above)
- **Architecture**: Apple Silicon native support with automatic Rosetta detection
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive Chinese comments with detailed function explanations and technical implementation

### Deployment
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions automated deployment
- **Environments**: Separate development and production environments
- **Domains**: ding.ahua.space (homepage), gh.ahua.space (script proxy)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### System Requirements

- macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or higher
- Locally downloaded app installation packages (DMG/ISO/PKG/ZIP/APP)
- Terminal access permissions

### Usage

Run the following command in Terminal:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://ding.ahua.space/install)
```

### Usage Flow

1. **Run Installation Script**: Execute the command above
2. **Select Packages**: Script scans current directory and common download locations
3. **Interactive Selection**: Use arrow keys to browse, spacebar to select apps for installation
4. **Confirm Installation**: Press enter to start the batch installation process
5. **View Results**: Check detailed installation report after completion

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

**Encrypted Disk Image Limitations**:
- Encrypted DMG or ISO files will interrupt the automated installation process
- It's recommended to decrypt or remove password protection before use
- The script will attempt to handle encrypted files, but may require manual intervention

**Other Usage Recommendations**:
- Ensure sufficient disk space for installation
- When installing many applications, consider closing other resource-intensive programs
- Do not manually operate Finder or mount/unmount disks during the installation process
